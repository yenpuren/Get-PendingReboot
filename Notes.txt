 07/27/2015:
-Added Domain Join detection to PendComputerRename, DOES NOT currently detect Workgroup Join/Change.
-Fixed Bug where a computer rename was not detected in 2008 R2 and above if a domain join occurred at the same time.

07/21/2015:
-This function no longer uses the .Net registry provider, it uses the StdRegProv WMI provider for more flexibility when using the ComputerName parameter to connect remotely.
-Added Pending Computer Rename - Detects whether or not a machine is pending a name change requiring a reboot.
-Fixed Bug where the CBServicing wasn't detected on Windows 10 and/or Windows Server Technical Preview (2016)

06/2013:
-SCCM Pending Reboot CCMClientSDK

Initial Release:
This function will query the registry on a local or remote computer and determine if the system is pending a reboot, from either Microsoft Patching or a Software Installation. For Windows 2008 & above the function will query the CBS registry key as another factor in determining pending reboot state.  "PendingFileRenameOperations" and "Auto Update\RebootRequired" are observed as being consistant across Windows Server 2003 & 2008. 

This function was featured on the Hey, Scripting Guy! Blog on June 10th/11th, 2013:

You must load this "script" as a "function" by "dot sourcing" the .ps1 file, as in the following example:
PS C:\> . .\Get-PendingReboot.ps1
This example assumes the path to the Get-PendingReboot.ps1 file is relative to the current directory.

Then the Function can be run:
PS C:\> Get-PendingReboot -ComputerName WKS01, WKS02, SVR01
